# UR/QR Code library for Qt5/6 (and Qt Quick)

This library is meant to enable quick displaying and
scanning QR/UR codes for Offline Transaction Signing.

It brings everything needed with it, most of the source
is stolen from [Feather Wallet](https://featherwallet.org),
[Monero](https://getmonero.org), [Blockchain Commons UR Library](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-ur),
[FUKUCHI libqrencode](https://fukuchi.org/works/qrencode/).

You should be able to use only parts of the complete library how
the parts build up on each other but are decoupled as much as possible.

There is still come lose ends I need to figure out and documentation missing.
Upmost qith the QtQuick part I still fighting with.

If it is after October 2024, and there is no documentation, feel free to
nag me.
